# Session Log: nxpp Project MVP & Test Suite

**Date:** March 24, 2026

## Objectives Reached in this Session

1. **Roadmap Definition and Planning**: 
   - Analysis of the initially provided isolated snippets regarding the Boost Graph Library engine configurations.
   - Creation of the comprehensive `ROADMAP.md` file to divide the C++ continuous integration of a "NetworkX-like" framework into 6 incremental phases.

2. **Base BGL Wrappers Integration (Phase 3)**:
   - Modified the base structure in previously deprecated headers to comfortably expose the encapsulated BGL core variables (`get_impl()`).
   - Created core pure C++ interfaces that perfectly simulate NetworkX behavioral signatures: `bfs_edges`, `dfs_edges`, `dijkstra_path`, `connected_components`, `strongly_connected_components`.

3. **C++ vs Python Testing Infrastructure (Phase 4)**:
   - Setup of a local virtual environment (`.venv`) for isolated installation of the `networkx` original Python module.
   - Initialization of a continuous comparative workflow generating network baselines using strictly sequential operations.
   - Creation of a heavily BGL-typed C++ test runner to load mathematically identical graphs, invoke compiled wrappers, and isolate outputs natively to `out_cpp.txt`.
   - Final terminal comparative processing via diff logs guaranteed a perfect **100% Topographical Match**.

4. **Python-Equivalent Algorithmic Prototypes**:
   - Examined internal snippets iteratively to map C++ output vectors cleanly, achieving 1-to-1 alignment with python outputs.

## Milestone 2: Generics & Header-Only Refactoring
1. **Library Architecture Consolidation (Single-Header)**: 
   - Fully eliminated the obsolete subdirectory tree architecture and successfully incorporated all active templates, algorithm modules, and utility helpers into a single overarching `include/nxpp.hpp` file.
2. **C++ Generics Architecture (NodeID)**:
   - Replaced fixed integer BGL Graph layouts with the infinitely adjustable template class `nxpp::Graph<NodeID>`. 
   - Implemented automatic memory-safe Hash Maps translating between Custom Generic IDs (textual inputs) and opaque Boost array allocation integer indices seamlessly. 
   - Added convenient User-Aliases like `nxpp::DiGraph` (which defaults directly to `std::string` nodes) for native rapid memory instantiation mirroring Python dynamics.
3. **Dictionary-like API System**:
   - Engineered the *EdgeProxy* to cleanly allow overriding sequential `G[Source][Target] = weight` mechanics simulating the robust continuous Python accessor dictionary lookups at O(1) speeds.
4. **I/O Display Simulator and Macro Parity**:
   - Brought forward a global variadic template `nxpp::print()` removing visually disruptive syntax elements across standard output mechanisms.
   - Reached unified topological code alignments linking `main.cpp` syntactically closer to `main.py` structural sequences than ever before.

## Milestone 3: Destruction Algorithms, MultiGraph, and Parity
1. **Node and Edge Destruction Algorithms (Phase 3)**:
   - Carefully maneuvered and securely integrated `clear()`, `remove_edge()`, `remove_node()` natively via internal proxy pointers.
   - Enforced standard C++ `vecS` array pointer translations leveraging standard O(1) *Memory Swap* logics natively built into BGL. This actively neutralized the critical topological array corruption invalidating downstream algorithms upon arbitrary deletion.
2. **Parallel Sub-architectures (Phase 1.5)**:
   - Resolved a massive implicit topological duplication glitch on the regular `nxpp::Graph` by automatically blocking repetitive shadow edge insertions. This mimics native generic python override behavior logic on identical key re-writes.
   - Finalized compilation sequences activating the new backend generic template parameter `bool Multi` to instantly unseal `MultiGraph` and `MultiDiGraph` multigraph structures enabling perfectly scaled parallel edges on demand.
3. **Comprehensive Documentation Refactoring**:
   - Rewrote `README.md` entirely emphasizing objective tone and deep architectural analyses.
   - Meticulously translated and maintained updates to both `ROADMAP.md` and `SESSION.md` fully recording Phase 1, Phase 2, and partial Phase 3 validations natively.
4. **Zero-Diff Parity Verification**:
   - Resolved non-deterministic SCC/CC ordering issues via lexicographical sorting in both languages.
   - Fixed `remove_node` vertex shifting bugs to ensure 100% BFS path consistency.
   - Achieved a perfect 0-diff output comparison between `nxpp` and `networkx`.
5. **Topological Generators (Phase 3)**:
   - Implemented `nxpp::complete_graph`, `nxpp::path_graph`, and `nxpp::erdos_renyi_graph`.
   - Optimized for generic `NodeID` via template overrides.
   - Integrated deterministic sorting in tests to maintain parity in complex graph structures.
