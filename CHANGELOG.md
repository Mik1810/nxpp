# Changelog

## 2026-03-25

- Added snippet-oriented API improvements in `include/nxpp.hpp`, including visitor-based traversal entry points, single-source shortest-path helpers, common graph aliases, component map helpers, and a const-friendly lookup wrapper.
- Added `scripts/test_snippets.sh` to compile and compare the `2sat`, `bellman_ford`, `bfs`, and `cc` snippet triplets while logging timings to both terminal and file.
- Reached snippet cleanup and parity work through `cc`; the next planned snippet pass is `dag_sp`.
